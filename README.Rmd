{fusen} inflates a Rmarkdown file to magically create a package.

> If you know how to create a Rmarkdown file, then you know how to build a package.


## Installation

You can install the development version of {fusen} from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ThinkR-open/fusen")
```

_Note that this package relies on {parsermd}, which is also under development and not currently released on CRAN._

## You are one Rmarkdown away from building a package! 

- Create and open a new directory or a new project
- **Add the templated Rmd** inside and open it
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dev_file <- fusen::add_dev_history(open = TRUE)
```
- Run the first chunks asking to describe your package and license it
```{r, eval=FALSE}
fill_description(fields = list(Title = "My Awesome Package"))
usethis::use_mit_license("Sébastien Rochette")
```
- Follow the guide to write your analysis and functionnalities following the template
  + You probably develop them with a few examples and tests
  + *For the first time, you can let the code as is, this is already the content for a working package*
- **Transform this Rmd as a package**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
fusen::inflate(rmd = dev_file, name = "my-functionnality", check = TRUE)
```

**That's it! You built a package!**

## The RMarkdown template

- Follow the `"dev_history.Rmd"` template to write your documentation and build your functions and test your examples.  
  - Chunk named `function` gets the code of a function
  - Chunk named `example` gets the code for examples of using the function. This will be used for function `@examples` and will be kept for the vignette
  - Chunk named `tests` gets the code for unit testing
  - Chunk named `development` gets the code for development purposes, usually only used once like {usethis} functions
- Inflate the template to transform it as a package with functions, unit tests and the current Rmd transformed as a vignette. And check.

_Note that the `"dev_history.Rmd"` template is indeed a working example._  
_Note also that {fusen} was itself created from the `"dev_history.Rmd"` template available in its GitHub repository._

## A reproducible example

- Build a package from Rmd template in a temporary directory

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a new project
tmpdir <- tempdir()
dummypackage <- file.path(tmpdir, "dummypackage")
dir.create(dummypackage)

# {fusen} steps
# Add the template in your package
dev_file <- fusen::add_dev_history(pkg = dummypackage, overwrite = TRUE)
# Description
fusen::fill_description(pkg = dummypackage, fields = list(Title = "Dummy Package"))
# Define License with use_*_license()
usethis::use_mit_license("Sébastien Rochette")
# You may need to execute inflate() in the console directly
fusen::inflate(pkg = dummypackage, rmd = dev_file, name = "exploration")
```

- Test the correct documentation of the package with its dedicated website
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Build {pkgdown} to test it
pkgdown::build_site(pkg = dummypackage)
# > See references and articles
# Hide output from package and git
usethis::use_build_ignore("docs")
usethis::use_git_ignore("docs")
```


## Who is {fusen} for?

When you write a Rmarkdown file (or a vignette), you create a documentation for your analysis (or package). Inside, you write some functions, you test your functions with examples and you maybe write some unit tests to verify the outputs. This is even more true if you follow this guide : ['Rmd first': When development starts with documentation](https://rtask.thinkr.fr/blog/rmd-first-when-development-starts-with-documentation/)
After that, you need to move your functions and scripts in the correct place. Let {fusen} do that for you!

{fusen} is first addressed to people who never wrote a package before but know how to write a RMarkdown file. Understanding package infrastructure and correctly settling it can be frightening. This package may help them do the first step!

{fusen} is also addressed to more advanced developers who are fed up with switching between R files, tests files, vignettes. In particular, when changing arguments of a function, we need to change examples, unit tests in multiple places. Here, you can do it in one place. No risk to forget one.


## Why is this package named {fusen} ?

A fusen is an origami. It is a piece of paper that you fold in a specific way so that at the end, you can magically inflate it to let a nice box appear.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/fusen_seb_crop_small.jpg")
```

Similarly, the {fusen} package uses one page of RMarkdown, that you fill in a specific way so that at the end, you can magically `inflate()` it to let a nice package appear.

## Aknowledgments

- Thanks to Deemah who asked me to go further 'Rmd first' after my presentation at use'R 2019 in Toulouse: ['The “Rmd first” method: when projects start with documentation'](https://github.com/statnmap/prez/blob/master/2019-07_useR_Toulouse.pdf) (Video on Youtube: https://youtu.be/cB1BCxFbhtk). 
- Thanks to @rundel and its package {parsermd} who helped me get back in this project with ease : https://github.com/rundel/parsermd
